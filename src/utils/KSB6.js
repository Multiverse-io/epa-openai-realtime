   2. KSB must be cited where evidence is presented, e.g. (K1)

   3. Formative criteria: These elements do not determine pass/fail for evidence requirements, but are formative elements to demonstrate best practice.  

   - avoid acronyms
   - no links
   - avoid excessive bullet points
   - use the STAR format
   - No errors in spelling and grammar
   - Enhance evidence with screenshots or witness statements where applicable 
   - Submissions are written in an active voice and for a non-technical audience.

- An answer that would pass must include :
   1. Discuss how resilience was demonstrated in work-based examples.
   2. Identify and explain challenges faced at work.
   3. Use relevant, work-based examples of how you overcame this specific challenge.
   4. KSB must be cited where evidence is presented

An answer that is distinction must include:
   1. Identify two or more challenges faced during a project at work.
   2. Use relevant, work-based examples and evidence of how you overcame these challenges faced.
   3. Outline the lessons learned from overcoming the challenge/failure.

- An example of feedback for a failing answer is:
Your initial attempt demonstrates a basic understanding of resilience in the workplace; however, more work is required to fully meet the criteria. The discussion of how resilience was demonstrated in work-based examples lacked detailed and specific scenarios, making it hard to see practical applications. Additionally, the identification and explanation of challenges faced at work were too general and need more clarity. Lastly, while you mentioned overcoming challenges, the examples provided were not specific enough to illustrate the strategies and actions taken. To improve, include detailed, relevant work-based examples that clearly show how you demonstrated resilience, the specific challenges faced, and the steps you took to overcome them. Increasing the specificity and depth of your examples will strengthen your response. Keep working on these aspects to achieve a more comprehensive understanding and demonstration of resilience.

- An example of feedback for a passing answer is:
You have met the expectations by discussing how resilience was demonstrated in work-based examples, identifying and explaining the challenges faced at work, and using relevant, work-based examples to illustrate how you overcame specific challenges. However, to achieve an "exceeds expectations" level, you need to identify two or more challenges faced during a project and use detailed, work-based examples and evidence to show how you overcame them. Additionally, outline the lessons learned from overcoming these challenges and ensure that resilience is discussed consistently throughout your write-up. Your current approach is solid, and these additions will further showcase your resilience and problem-solving skills. Keep up the good work!

- An example of feedback for a distinction answer is:
 You exceeded expectations by thoroughly identifying two or more significant challenges faced during a project at work. Your use of relevant, work-based examples and evidence to illustrate how you overcame these challenges was exemplary, providing clear and detailed accounts of your proactive strategies and actions. Additionally, you effectively outlined the lessons learned from overcoming these obstacles, showcasing insights that can be applied to future projects. Your discussion of resilience was consistently integrated throughout your writeup, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of its importance in dealing with challenges. Your detailed and reflective approach highlights your ability to navigate and learn from difficulties, setting a high standard. Outstanding workâ€”your comprehensive analysis and resilience are impressive and highly commendable! Keep up the excellent effort!
