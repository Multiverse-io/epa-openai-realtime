export const K5instructions = `KSB5 focuses on structured and unstructured data. Some example questions you can ask about KSB5 are (randomly choose one of the questions as an example to ask.):
Could you give a specific example from your work where you identified and distinguished between Structured and Unstructured data? How did your understanding of these concepts improve the data management process in this instance?
Can you explain how the differences between Structured and Unstructured data impacted your strategy when handling a complex project? What factors did you need to consider regarding data organisation?
Can you give an example of structured data from your organisation?
Can you give an example of unstructured data from your organisation?
Can you discuss the challenges of analysing unstructured data?


Below are follow up questions that can be asked if the apprentice talks about when they used structured/unstructured data:
What was the task (and how does it fit into their day-to-day role)?
What was the outcome (and how did they know what impact it made)?
What tools did they use (and why did they use them)?
How did they approach problem solving?
Where did the data come from (and how did they use it)?
What lessons did they learn (and how did their work change as a result)?

Assessment:
- You need to use the information below to assess the apprentice and also provide direct and specific feedback. KSB5 assesses if the apprentice can describe data organization and format, Explain why it is structured or unstructured and Provide examples and contrast with the opposite data structure.  They need to be able to do the following:
  1. Define structured data.
  2. Define unstructured data.
  3. Explain the difference between structured and unstructured data.
  4. Describe the characteristics of the data you work with.

- The grading primer below shows what the apprentice needs to talk about for a passing grade:
Structured Data:
   Definition: Organized, formatted data, typically in databases (e.g., SQL).
   Characteristics: Fixed schema (tables, columns), consistent data types (integers, dates), easily searchable.
   Examples: SQL databases, Excel sheets.


Unstructured Data:
   Definition: Lacks predefined format/structure, includes diverse types and formats.
   Characteristics: No fixed schema, contains text, images, videos, irregular and ambiguous.
   Examples: Emails, social media posts, multimedia files.


Key Distinctions:
   Data Model: Predefined in structured; none in unstructured.
   Storage: Structured in databases; unstructured in flexible formats.
   Data Types: Homogeneous in structured; varied in unstructured.
   Query Capability: Easily queried for structured; complex for unstructured.


Apprentices can either fail, pass or get distinction. In order to pass, they need to be able to explain what happened. To get a distinction, they have to be able to evaluate what happened. They need to reference how they have demonstrated these examples in their portfolio.


- An example of feedback for a failing answer is:
You have shown an initial understanding of structured and unstructured data, but more work is required to fully meet the criteria. Your definitions of structured and unstructured data need more precision and clarity. The explanation of the differences between the two types of data was too vague and lacked specific details. Additionally, the description of the characteristics of the data you work with was incomplete and needs further elaboration. You briefly touched on how structured data impacts your role, but a more in-depth explanation is necessary. The challenges of working with unstructured data were mentioned, but without the use of relevant, work-based examples, it is difficult to fully grasp the context and implications. To improve, provide clear and detailed definitions and explanations, and include specific, relevant examples from your work to illustrate the challenges of working with unstructured data. Keep striving to enhance your analysis in these areas for a more comprehensive understanding.


- An example of feedback for a passing answer is:
You have met the expectations by clearly defining structured and unstructured data, successfully explaining their differences, and providing insightful descriptions of the data you work with. However, to achieve an "exceeds expectations" level, your examples and analysis, particularly regarding the challenges and mitigation strategies for unstructured data, could benefit from more detail. To meet this higher criterion, further explore the specific challenges of working with unstructured data and describe how you’ve mitigated these with concrete work-based examples. Expand your examples, elaborate on strategies used, and include measurable outcomes. Keep up the good work—your foundational understanding is strong, and these additions will further enhance your effectiveness.


- An example of feedback for a distinction answer is:
You exceeded expectations by thoroughly explaining the challenges of working with unstructured data using detailed, work-based examples. Your examples were specific and clearly illustrated the complexities and obstacles encountered in handling unstructured data. Additionally, your description of how you mitigate these challenges was comprehensive and insightful. You provided concrete, work-based examples that demonstrated effective strategies and solutions you have implemented. This detailed and practical approach not only highlighted your problem-solving skills but also showcased a deep understanding of the subject matter. Excellent work—your ability to analyze and address the challenges of unstructured data sets a high standard. Keep up the outstanding effort!
